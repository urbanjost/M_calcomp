    Differences between the implemented routines and the standard CALCOMP
    routines are:
<br />
     o All coordinate values should be greater than or equal to zero, and
       less than 100 inches. Values outside this range may result in
       unpredictable results (Negative values are possible if the
       frame coordinate origin is set first using the PLOT call).
<br />
     o The metalanguage output filename is &ldquo;pdf&rdquo;, and uses FORTRAN
       unit 50 unless an appropriate alternate value is specified
       in the PLOTS routine call. The output filename may be specified
       using the environment variable CALCOMP_PDF.
<br />
     o A routine NFRAME is available for creating multiple frames for
       graphic devices other than pen plotters.
<br />
     o Color is supported via the NEWPEN routine
<br />
     o Line thickness is supported via the WIDTH routine
<br />
     o Frames will not plot to true inches unless specific steps are
       taken in the generation and post-processing of the plot file.
<br />
    of inches.</p>
     <p>
  Other changes may be needed in existing CALCOMP code from vendors as
  CALCOMP has produced several versions of CALCOMP routines that vary in
  such ways as use of CHARACTER variables versus Hollerith, the number
  of parameters on SYMBOL calls, and the current pen position after a
  call to SYMBOL.
<br>
<blockquote>
    <p>The CALCOMP subroutines were written for use with CALCOMP pen
    plotters and originally worked in units of inches for the mapping
    of the plot directly to the output device. There are two classes of
    CALCOMP subroutines-<b>-those USING TRUE INCHES.</p> that accept user units and scale
    them to inches and those that require data to be directly in units
    of inches.phics post processing procedures use the CALCOMP inches
    to determine the aspect ratio of the plot, and the plot is made as
    large as possible for a given device while maintaining the aspect
    ratio specified by the user CALCOMP calls. A parameter called SIZE
    is included with most graphics post-processor procedures which

    <p>Important differences exist between this CALCOMP and "standard"
    CALCOMP interfaces third-party software often provides interfaces
    to. The format of the following primary example program can be used
    as a guide as to how to nullify the affects of these differences.of
     the call to SYMBOL, the calling sequence was modified to have 7
     arguments. All programs being converted from the 7600
     -MUST- make this change to the call to SYMBOL.
<br />
    <pre>
  DIFFERENCES FROM 7600 CALCOMP LIBRARIES
<br />
  1. For subroutines SYMBOL, AXIS, and LGAXS, the parameter used to
     specify text or title information (IBCD) has been changed to be
     type CHARACTER to be consistent with ANSI 77 FORTRAN. Data for these
     arguments should be changed to be type CHARACTER (although use of
     a Hollerith string or INTEGER array may currently work, their use is
     not recommended, and there are no plans to support this usage).
<br />
  2. For subroutine SYMBOL on the 7600s, there is a "STANDARD" call
     (used to plot a text string) and a "SPECIAL" call (used to plot a
     single symbol). To Accommodate CHARACTER data and both versions of
     the call to SYMBOL, the calling sequence was modified to have 7
     arguments. All programs being converted from the 7600
     -MUST- make this change to the call to SYMBOL.
<br />
     The new calling sequence is
<br />
           CALL SYMBOL(XPAGE,YPAGE,HEIGHT,IBCD,INTEQ,ANGLE,NCHAR)
<br />

      <pre>
    <blockquote>
      Where XPAGE, YPAGE, HEIGHT, and ANGLE are defined as on the 7600s,
      and the user guide can be consulted for details of their use.

      <p>The last parameter NCHAR is used as a flag to specify whether a
      text string or a single symbol is being plotted. If NCHAR is less
      that zero, a single symbol is plotted regardless of the contents
      of IBCD. If NCHAR is equal to or greater than zero the string
      in IBCD is used (FAILURE TO SPECIFY THE PROPER VALUE FOR NCHAR,
      INTEQ OR IBCD WILL CAUSE ERRONEOUS RESULTS).LBL = 'TITLE 10'
         CALL SYMBOL(1.0,1.0,0.14,GRLBL,999,0.0,8)
<br />

      <p>To use SYMBOL to plot text for titles, captions, or legends--9,0.0,8)
<br />

      <pre>
        IBCD--Contains the text string as CHARACTER data.
<br />
        INTEQ--Should be set to 999 .
               (THE ACTUAL VALUE IS NOT USED FOR ANYTHING.)
<br />
        NCHAR--Is the number of characters in IBCD.
<br />
               symbol (where XPAGE and YPAGE specify the center of
               the symbol) is produced. The symbol table is unchanged
               from that on the 7600s, so the table on page 2-10 of the
               7600 CALCOMP guide is still applicable.
<br />For example, the following call to SYMBOL will result in the characters
      <pre>
         CHARACTER GRLBL*8
         GRLBL = 'TITLE 10'
         CALL SYMBOL(1.0,1.0,0.14,GRLBL,999,0.0,8)
<br />
               to XPAGE and YPAGE. (IT MUST BE NEGATIVE.)
<br />To use SYMBOL to plot a single symbol or character--
      <pre>
        IBCD--  A dummy CHARACTER variable or string should be used
                THE ACTUAL VALUE IS NOT USED FOR ANYTHING.)
<br />
        INTEQ--Contains the INTEGER EQUIVALENT of the desired symbol.
               If INTEQ has a value of 0 (zero) through 14, a centered
               symbol (where XPAGE and YPAGE specify the center of
               the symbol) is produced. The symbol table is unchanged
               from that on the 7600s, so the table on page 2-10 of the
               7600 CALCOMP guide is still applicable.
<br />
        NCHAR--Determines whether the pen is up or down during the move
               to XPAGE and YPAGE. (IT MUST BE NEGATIVE.)
<br />
               When NCHAR is--
<br />
                -1, the pen is UP during the move.
                -2 or less, the pen is DOWN during the move.

   For example, the following call to SYMBOL will result in special symbol
   number 5 being output with its center at XY coordinates of (1.0,1.0).
